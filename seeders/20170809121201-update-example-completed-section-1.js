- Secondary Objective 4: To assess the efficacy of EEDEV-3456 compared to Standard of Care tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in terms of Disease Control Rate, in patients with advanced NSCLC\n
- Secondary Endpoint 4: Disease Control Rate measured as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response of CR or PR or SD (Stable disease)\n
- Secondary Objective 5: To assess the efficacy of EEDEV-3456 compared to Standard of Care tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in terms of Depth of response, in patients with advanced NSCLC\n
- Secondary Endpoint 5: Depth of Response measured as the relative change in the sum of the longest diameters of RECIST target lesions at the nadir in the absence of new lesions or progression of non-target lesions compared to baseline\n
* Safety\n
- Safety Objective 1: To assess the safety and tolerability profile EEDEV-3456 compared to Standard of Care in the first line setting for treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC\n
